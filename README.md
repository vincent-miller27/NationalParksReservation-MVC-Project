# NationalParksReservation-MVC-Project

## Overview

This project was originally created as a console application for a mini capstone project to practice our skills with C# and SQL. I used some of the original code along with added features to create this application with MVC.

## Motivation

The motivation for this project was to test the skills we learned using MVC on my own. Although some of the original code was written with my capstone team members, all of the MVC related actions are my own work. The mini capstone projects are designed for us to post on GitHub, and it is up to us to add more if we please. I wanted to start a small project of my own to have something special to talk about.

## Installation

To successfully run the project, you need to download Microsoft Visual Studio, which can be done for free on the internet.

## Features

As the user, you should be able to:

-View a list of the parks, which are uploaded from a database.
-Click on the name of the park or its picture to view more details of it
-From the park detail screen, you can choose to see its campground
-You can choose a specific campground and search for available campsites with the search queries provided
-From there you can make your reservation and the confirmation page will provide your reservation ID
-You can also search for available campsites directly from the park page and make a reservation

## Additional Information

The original project was completed with two other teams members
